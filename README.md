# Align_Top_Bottom_Handler
A simple .cpp file to align the clicked part of an object (in osg,opengl or any computer graphics library) to top or bottom face

In this project we have taken the triangle coordinates of the mouse clicked part of an object(mesh) and aligned it to top/bottom face by finding rotation matrix and finally finding required angle rotation in radians about x then about y and finally about z.
